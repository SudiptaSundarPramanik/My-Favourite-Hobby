        <p>My Favourite Hobby<br><br>
            My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
            started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
            kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
            when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.<br>
            I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it
            at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very
            challenging.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Books</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
        favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of
        advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
        vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me
        an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different
        cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.

        <p>Books have the power to inspire and do many more things. Books are our truest friends who provide us with a treasure house of knowledge and information. Much like our friends, they give us inspiration and encourage us to do great things. We get pleasure from reading the stories of far-away lands and from learning about the mysteries of the Universe. We get motivated by the biographies of great men and are inspired to follow in their footsteps. Books teach us not only about science and logic but also about morality and values. They help us overcome our shortcomings and sculpt us into ideal human beings. Therefore, everyone should read books.
